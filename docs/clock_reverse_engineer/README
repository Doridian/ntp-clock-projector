This documents the LCD control signal output from the Skyscan Projection Alarm Clock.

The board has two 6-pin connectors, that I identify as the blue and red connectors, indexed 0 to 5.

In this folder are oscilloscope image captures of the signals from these pins.

The goal is to identify the common pins, which should have a signal that remains constant.

To do this, I'll screencapture all the pins twice, a few hours apart.

The common pins should be the ones that remain unchanged.

I've confirmed the LCD is multiplexed, but I'm unsure how many common pins it has. It could have anywhere between 1 and 4.
