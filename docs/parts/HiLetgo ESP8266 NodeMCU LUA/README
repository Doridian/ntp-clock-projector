    "I picked D1(GPIO5), and D2(GPIO4) as my bus ports."

    NodeMCU GPIO5 -> SCL (RTC) -> SCL (OLED)
    NodeMCU GPIO4 -> SDA (RTC) -> SDA (OLED)

    the SCL as Arduino Analog Pin A4 is connected to D1 on NodeMCU at the same time
    the D2 as the SDA represent as Analog Pin A5 on Arduino Board

D1 = SDA? SCL?
D2 = SCL? SDA?
